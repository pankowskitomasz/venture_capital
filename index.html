                        The pace of venture capital investment in fintechs, like many aspects of the economy, 
                        has slowed this year — but the demand for digital finance at a time of social 
                        distancing, and other factors, are expected to buoy the numbers in coming months
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Globally, venture capital firms invested $6 billion in fintech companies in the 
                        first quarter, down 45% from the fourth quarter and 25% less than in the first 
                        quarter of 2019, according to the data analysis firm CB Insights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the U.S., there was a slight uptick: to $3.7 billion in the first quarter from 
                        $3.6 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the research company 
                        Crunchbase, which tracked more than 12,000 startups for a recent report.

                    <p>
                        Funds begin with a capital-raising period where the venture capital firm seeks 
                        out investors for the new fund. Depending on the firm’s reputation, market 
                        conditions, and fund strategy, the process can take months or even years. Once 
                        the targeted funding amount’s been reached, the fund is closed to new investors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afterward, the venture capital firm initiates a three- to five-year investment 
                        period in which the fund manager allocates the capital to investment companies 
                        and builds the portfolio. The focus shifts to managing the portfolio and providing 
                        the necessary resources to the investment firms to increase the odds of a profitable 
                        exit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The total lifecycle of a venture capital fund lasts about seven to ten years, 
                        starting from the moment the fund is closed and ending once all deals are exited, 
                        and any profits are redistributed to the investors.

                    <p>
                        The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act strives to make the effective tax rates for investors 
                        and owners of pass-through entities line up with recently reduced corporate tax 
                        rates. Thanks to the new Section 199A, taxpayers may receive a 20 percent deduction 
                        of their share of business income as long as a qualified business generated the 
                        income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, a large amount of venture capital funds will not be able to factor 
                        this into their bookkeeping because, in some cases, the investment income a venture 
                        capital firm generates does not meet the definition of qualified business income.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, venture capital firms that work in a tiered structure may receive qualified 
                        business income from their investments in lower-tiered pass-through entities. This 
                        may allow them to factor the above 20 percent deduction into their venture capital 
                        tax planning.

                                        Business funding was so easy to work with. Great customer service and was 
                                        right there when I need the funds. Thank you for the great experience.
